Task
An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as
 February 29, and the day is called a leap day.
It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes
 approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun.
A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar,
 three conditions are used to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

year = int(input("Введите год: "))
if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
